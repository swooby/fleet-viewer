# Fleet VieweR

View your 3D fleet in Virtual Reality.

Written in Unity, currently only Google VR Daydream is supported, but other platforms could be supported if there is a high enough demand.

The base of this app will be a generic 3D model importer.
Star Citizen (SC) will be first-class supported with pre-defined models.
Eventually the SC models will be refreshable from the SC website (robertsspaceindustries.com).

## Milestones

### Core
  * v1 Add and view single hard coded model
  * v2 Add and view multiple hard coded models
  * v3 Import/Refresh model(s) from URL [and save]
  * v4 Auto-Arrange and/or Sort multiple models

## Ideas
### Star Citizen
  * Import your Hangar and select which ships you want auto-imported
  * Use not-currently-existing Star Citizen API to:
    * Report stats/location/contents of ships/vehicles
    * Report UEC
